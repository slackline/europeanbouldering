Compiled a lot of bouldering locations and posted them as POIs on [[http://ukbouldering.com/board/index.php/board,34.0.html][UKBouldering.com]].  In particular the [[http://ukbouldering.com/board/index.php/topic,6809.0.html][UK venues]] and the 
[[http://ukbouldering.com/board/index.php/topic,7519.0.html][Climbing Walls 
(UK)]].

** Paul Bennet

Compiled various POIs for [[http://ukbouldering.com/board/index.php/topic,13442.0.html][climbing locations in Europe]] which are included.

** Simon (sjw)

Compiled POIs for [[http://ukbouldering.com/board/index.php/topic,26390.0.html][North Yorkshire Moors]].



POIs were converted to GPX and these in turn converted to GeoJSON using [[https://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/][toGeoJSON]]
